# Vector: The Mind Reader

Meet **Vector**, a highly intelligent robot created by the renowned scientist Dr. Zafeer. Vector is designed to read minds, but there are two small problemsâ€”**Vector needs training and it get bored!**  

According to **ACT 876 of NEXIM City**:

> It is hereby declared the solemn duty of all humans to ensure the entertainment and mental well-being of robots within the jurisdiction of NEXIM City. Failure to comply with this mandate shall result in penalties, including but not limited to, a term of **imprisonment not exceeding five (5) years**.

So, to keep both Vector and yourself happy, why not play a little game to entertain and train vector?  

Are you ready to help train Vector and have some fun along the way? Let the guessing begin!
